# PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - SAVE POINT
**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Time**: Session End  
**Status**: MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED! 🎉

## 🏆 BREAKTHROUGH COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### ✅ SALES MODULE - 100% COMPLETE!
**ALL 10 SALES TESTS NOW PASSING!** 

#### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Payment Creation** - Fixed PaymentSerializer to handle 'sale' field properly
2. ✅ **Customer Management** - Fixed nested user data structure  
3. ✅ **Sale Creation** - Added SaleCreateSerializer with proper item handling
4. ✅ **Pharmacy Sales Filtering** - Fixed pagination response handling (was returning dict keys instead of results)

#### Key Fix Applied:
- **Problem**: Test expected `len(response.data) == 1` but got 4 (dict keys)
- **Solution**: Updated test to use `response.data['count'] == 1` for paginated responses
- **Result**: Perfect pharmacy-specific filtering now working
