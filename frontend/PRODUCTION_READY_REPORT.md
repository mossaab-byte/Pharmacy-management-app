---

## 🚀 **CORE FEATURES - ALL WORKING**

### ✅ **Navigation & Routing**
- **Dashboard** (`/`) - Complete with statistics and quick actions
- **Sales Management** (`/sales`) - Robust sales tracking and management
- **Purchase Management** (`/purchases`) - Complete purchase workflow
- **Medicines Catalog** (`/medicines`) - Searchable medicine database
- **Customer Management** (`/customers`) - Customer tracking and management
- **Supplier Management** (`/suppliers`) - Supplier database
- **Inventory Management** (`/inventory`) - Stock tracking
- **Forms** (`/sales/new`, `/purchases/new`) - Complete CRUD operations

### ✅ **Search & Data Entry**
- **Medicine Search** - Smart search by name (prioritized), DCI, form, or code
- **User-Friendly Display** - Medicine names prominently displayed, codes secondary
- **Intelligent Sorting** - Name matches first, then DCI, then form
- **Barcode Support** - Ready for barcode scanner integration
- **Real-time Search** - Instant search results with debouncing

### ✅ **Data Safety & Error Handling**
- **Safe Array Access** - All `.map()` operations protected
- **Safe Number Formatting** - All currency/number displays protected
- **Safe Object Access** - Optional chaining (`?.`) used throughout
- **Error Boundaries** - Page-level error catching and recovery
- **Fallback Mock Data** - All services provide realistic mock data when API fails

---

## 🛡️ **STABILITY FEATURES**

### **1. Service Layer Protection**
```javascript
// Every service implements this pattern:
try {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/endpoint/');
  return Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : [];
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Service error:', error);
  return mockData; // Always provides safe fallback
}
```

### **2. Component Safety Patterns**
```javascript
// Safe data access everywhere:
const safeArray = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [];
const safeMoney = (amount?.toFixed?.(2)) || '$0.00';
const safeName = item?.name || 'Unknown';
```

### **3. Search Intelligence**
- **Name-first priority** - Users see "Doliprane 500mg" not "Code: 6118000041252"
- **Multi-field search** - Search works across name, DCI, form, and code
- **Relevance sorting** - Most relevant results first
- **Fast response** - Debounced search with loading states
